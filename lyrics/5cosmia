Cosmia

When you ate I saw your eyelashes
Saw them shake like wind on grasses
In the corn field when she called me
Moths surround me, thought they'd drown me

And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart

Dried rose petal, red brown circles
Framed your eyes and stained your knuckles
Dried rose petal, red brown circles
Framed your eyes and stained your knuckles

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water, water in
But though I tried so hard my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in

And all those lonely nights down by the river
I was brought my bread and water by the kith and the kin
Now in the quiet hour when I am sleepin'
I cannot keep the night from comin' in

Why've you gone away
Gone away again
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
If you've gone away again
I sleep through the rest of my days
And I sleep through the rest of my days
And I sleep through the rest of my days

Why've you gone away, away
Seven suns, seven suns
Away, away, away, away

Can you hear me, will you listen
Don't come near me, don't go missing
In the lissome light of evening
Help me, Cosmia, I'm grieving

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water, water in
But though I tried so hard my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in

And all those lonely nights down by the river
I was brought my bread and water by the kith and the kin
Now in the quiet hour when I am sleepin'
I cannot keep the night from comin' in

Beneath the porch light we've all been circling
Beat our dust hearts, singe our flour wings
But in the corner, something is happening
Wild Cosmia, what have you seen

Water were your limbs, and the fire was her hair
And then the moonlight caught your eye
And you rose through the air
Well, if you've seen true light, then this is my prayer
Will you call me when you get there

And I miss your precious heart
And miss, and miss, and miss
And miss, and miss, and miss, and miss, and miss your heart
But release your precious heart
To its feast, for precious hearts
